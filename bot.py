update_excel() is a function to update the Excel file / spreadsheet for offline database manipulation.
This implementation (as of 2024-10-25) allows the bot host to update the database by simply altering the
spreadsheet, and vice versa; changes through the bot / db update the spreadsheet at the specified path in .env.

This function will work correctly regardless of whether users rename the template spreadsheet (called "PlayerStats.xlsx"), but do not change the sheet name inside it from "PlayerStats".
In this code, the "workbook" is what we normally call a spreadsheet, and the "sheet name" is just a tab inside that spreadsheet.
So, don't confuse the two and think that you can't change the spreadsheet's file name to something different; you can, as long as you leave the tab/sheet name unaltered and
update the spreadsheet path in ".env".
